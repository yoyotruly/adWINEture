Louis Roederer et Philippe Starck Brut Nature Champagne 2009,112.95,Champagne,"The 2009 Brut Nature is only the second release for this wine (the first was the 2006). Powerful, rich and impeccably layered, the 2009 possesses remarkable depth and all of the pedigree of these vineyards in Cumières. Apricot, brioche, dried flowers and chamomile take on striking shades of translucence in this beautifully expressive Champagne. The radiance and ripeness of the vintage gave Roederer the ideal conditions to make a Champagne with no dosage, and here it is, in all of its splendor. Roederer has made the decision to price this wine very modestly in Champagne terms. I can't imagine that is going to last too long. To be sure, the Brut Nature style might come as a bit of a shock to readers used to the Roederer house palate, but the wine is magnificent. It's as simple as that. Drinking window: 2016-2024.

The 'ultimate expression of blending' was created in 2004 and kept for ten years on the lees of the second (respectively third) fermentation. The cuvée 001.14 was disgorged in 2014 as Brut with a dosage of four or five grams per liter.

Veuve Clicquot Extra Brut Extra Old Champagne,111.0,Champagne,"The 'Assemblage' - a preciser word than blend to describe its intricacy - is drawn from the house's famous collection of reserve wines, in particular the 1988, 1996, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010 vintages. The grape varieties are very close to the classic choices that Veuve Clicquot herself preferred as she built her brand post 1815: today, 47% Pinot Noir, 27% Chardonnay and 26% Pinot Meunier - the quintessence of the house's heritage & core values. More innovatively, and perhaps uniquely among the big houses, Veuve Clicquot Extra Brut, Extra Old is double aged - three years on lees in vats (up to 5% oak), then three years in bottle before release. This slow maturing allows the wine to become soft and mellow yet light-footed, needing a tiny dosage of just three grams of sugar; the smallest figure in the house's history. A Champagne for refined cuisine - try tartare of scallops, risottos, sushi and sashimi. Lovely colour bright, delicate gold twinkles, superfine flowing cordon of bubbles.

In the hands of Paul Pender it seems obvious that pinot gris is the one. This dry take is just about perfectly right, with citrus and wet stone hanging around the fruit. Leaner might be more suitable but ultimately it's balance that is most important for this rich fruit raised by the pottery soil. Drink: 2018-2020.  Score - 89.

This wine matured in well-seasoned, neutral 300-, 400- and 500-liter oak barrels for eight months and was then blended with the Manzanilla. This is the way Monopole was always produced decades ago.

Trius Showcase Wild Ferment Chardonnay 2015,36.95,Chardonnay,"By now reliably one of the better chardonnays in Niagara, and Canada, Trius's Showcase Oliveira vineyard bottling from winemaker Craig Macdonald's favorite little patch of red clay down by the lake in the Lincoln Lakeshore sub-appellation, turns from showy to tight, back to showy again as it evolves in the glass. I'd leave this in the cellar for another 2-3 years minimum to see the pieces of the puzzle line up more seamlessly, but all of the pieces are present: clearly dense, ripe, highly extracted flavours, top quality wood, and in the case of the 2015 vintage, remarkably ripe fruit that flirts with the tropical-pineapple spectrum, but ultimately finds its comfort zone in ripe orchard fruit and creamy lemon.

It comes in at 14% alcohol. In a way, noting that the vintage years were rather different, this is a replay of the 2016 Little Odisseia, except with a bit better depth and structure. It retains the same elegance and silky feel, now leaning to Burgundy, and the same fresh fruit. The flavors are still vivid but even a little more controlled, no doubt due to the subtle wood impact. This is not a big, fat and powerful Reserva, but it is a wonderfully graceful and tasty one. I was willing to lean up a bit on Little Odisseia.

Ten years later, there is no doubt that our cellars get their best wines from Talinay, such as this Sauvignon?Tabali's best?born from a selection of the most calcareous soils of Talinay, which have a great impact in its character. This wine is made of stone. There are no fruits. If you taste Pedregoso and Vetas Blancas (of the same vintage), you could feel this same mineral effect, but not at such high levels.

Errazuriz Aconcagua Costa Las Pizarras Chardonnay 2017,70.0,Chardonnay,"The 2017 Aconcagua Costa 'Las Pizarras' Chardonnay is really fascinating, and it's even sharper, more restrained and with higher acidity than the 2016 that I tasted next to it. Winemaker Francisco 'Pancho' Baettig is really pushing the wine to the limits - harvesting early and with more concentration and structure achieved through lower yields, which provides depth and complexity. The origin is the same as for 2016, and so is the vinification and aging in French barriques for almost 13 months. This is really young and austere, and it took some time in the glass to open up. It has Chablis-like definition, austerity and crispness; it's pure, mineral, long, precise like a laser cut, symmetric and chiseled. Even if it's sharp and citrusy, the palate has more volume and depth, and some nutty notes appear after some time. It's more like a Meursault than a Chablis this time, with great length, and I couldn't help but think of the whites from Jean-Marc Roulot when tasting this. It's a monumental mineral white, with the coastal freshness and the slate tastiness. This is hands down the best vintage of Las Pizarras and the best Chardonnay I've ever tasted from Chile. It's amazing how this wine has developed in only four vintages. As an American friend of mine would say, it's awesome beyond belief! Drink Date: 2018-2030.  Score - 98.

Back then, it represented a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier. We saw the percentage of Viognier reduced in the 2014 vintage and it has now been completely removed in this edition. This wine is a pure expression of Sauvignon and I'm told that the 2016 vintage will be the same. The wine was bottled in December 2016, so I preview tasted it just a few months after it was put into glass. Because 2015 is a warm vintage, General Manager Alex Heinz tells me that the Viognier risked tasting too heavy and viscous. Instead, you get the crisp linearity and pristine aromas that remind you of a white Bordeaux, evidently the inspiration for this Tuscan wine. It is fermented in 30% new oak and rests on the lees for one year with frequent stirring. The wine is rich and silky in texture with fragrances of exotic fruit, honey and saffron. There is a delicate touch of alcohol as well. Balanced acidity and salty mineral nuances cap the powerful experience. Drink Date: 2018-2028.  Score - 93.

A small part of the blend was aged for six months in French oak. This has been seen before, but it is worth another look as it is a very fine value. It is still gloriously fruity, intense in flavor, yet showing lift to the fruit all the time. It is always fresh and lively, never jammy and sweet, even while very fruity. That may seem like a contradiction, but it's not. With more time in the bottle, it also is showing a bit more muscle as the fruit comes into perfect balance with the structure. This is even better now and a terrific value. Frankly, I'm not always sure how wines like this will age, because its fresh fruit is its biggest advantage. However, acidity also preserves. Plus, this is now showing a little complexity and it is better in perceptible structure, without the fruit losing much of anything.

Estate cabernet of such acumen is predicated on the sound wisdom gathered by a viticulturist and Vineland's Roman Prydatkewycz knows his cabernet. Winemaker Brian Schmidt takes this paradigmatic escarpment fruit, passes it through the optimal sorter, removes five to eight per cent imperfect berries and a quarter of the cabernet sauvignon fruit.

Carlos San Pedro planted it with a massal selection that ripens quite early; in fact, in 2017 it was the first vineyard they harvested. It ripens properly and keeps good acidity.

Macán 2013,100.0,Red Blend,"The youthful-looking 2013 Macán is pure Tempranillo sourced from a myriad of plots of old vines from the 90 hectares of vineyards they own mostly in the village of San Vicente de la Sonsierra.

The two wines from 2013 share a common characteristic, which is better integrated oak and a subtler mouthfeel.

Here there is a mixture of red and black fruit, and some notes of dark spices. The palate shows very polished tannins and good balance, more serious than the Clásico.

Uccelliera Brunello di Montalcino 2012,97.0,Sangiovese,"I am always such a big fan of Andrea Cortonesi's work. Like his previous releases, the 2012 Brunello di Montalcino shows an uncanny sense of continuity and consistency with past releases. This steady stylistic focus is one of the best reasons to buy Uccelliera Brunello. The wine is dark and rich in appearance.

The nose is remarkably complex, offering scents of dark red and black cherry and berry, rose petal, aged leather, and turned earth. A noticeable contrast to the 'Beehive' bottling, with more structure, more savory and earthy facets, less flashy fruit, and slightly more oak contribution at this young age. A very sophisticated wine that is clearly built to age. The mid weight flavors of black raspberry and blackberry are set off by notes of spice and toast and emerge slowly in the glass over time. The finish is uncommonly generous as all great wines are. When tasted several hours later, the wine was more giving, indicating that it should be decanted if drunk now, but will benefit from more time in the cellar.

I think vinification and élevage is now a secondary consideration for these Mas Alta wines because what I have in the glass is much more about the place, which to me makes the wine much more interesting. This is balsamic with notes hinting on camphor, but mainly rosemary, fennel and thyme with even a floral touch and a mixture of black and red berries and some spiciness thrown in.

Jeff Cohn Iron Hill Zinfandel 2013,77.0,Zinfandel,"The 2013 Zinfandel Iron Hill Vineyard is slightly less powerful at 15.2% alcohol. Coming from hard volcanic soils, this wine was aged 16 months in about 30% new French oak and produced another relatively small cuvée of 206 cases from the steep hillsides of the Iron Hill Vineyard. Cohn compares this wine to a French Côte-Rôtie, and I can see the legitimacy in his analysis. The wine has a fragrance in the nose that almost gives the sense that there are some white grapes contributing to the floral notes in the bouquet. There aren't any, as this is 100% Zinfandel, but the color is not as dense as its predecessor. Still, the complexity and richness are endearing.

Castiglion del Bosco Millecento Riserva Brunello di Montalcino 2010,222.0,Sangiovese,"The 2010 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Millecento shows a level of extreme elegance and harmony that I did not find in the 2008 vintage of this same wine. The fact that 2010 is a better vintage is an obvious asset, but I believe that the folks at Castiglion del Bosco have generally switched to a more streamlined wine style across their entire portfolio. This is a very welcome change. The bouquet opens slowly to reveal wild berry, balsam herb and pressed flowers. The wine is more vertical in approach than it is horizontal. In other words, the aromas lift gracefully with balanced intensity and buoyancy. I also suspect that this wine will promise a much longer aging potential compared to past incarnations.

Xavier Vignon Arcane Le Pape Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2010,159.0,Grenache,"With regards to the 2010 Châteauneuf du Pape Arcane Le Pape, I had to have Xavier explain how he made it about three times before I understood. The wine is 100% Grenache, from 15 different parcels, that was put into a barrel, then the entire barrel was put into a concrete tank, which was then filled with wine. This is a take on the underwater aging process that some people experiment with, and the result is that's there's no exposure to oxygen whatsoever, and the wine was kept like this for five years, with no racking or topping (since there's no evaporation, it never needed to be topped). Inky purple in color, with a sensational, youthful bouquet of crushed flowers, blueberries, blackberries, cured meats and spice, it hits the palate with incredible richness, a thick, unctuous mid-palate and ripe, yet present tannin. It's a singular, exotic beauty that I wish every reader could taste!

Errázuriz La Cumbre Syrah 2015,90.0,Shiraz/Syrah,"The 2015 La Cumbre is produced as a mix of Syrah grapes from the cooler Max 5 vineyard in Aconcagua, with less from Max 1, and from vines in the cooler Aconcagua Costa. The hand-picked grapes were destemmed, crushed and fermented in stainless steel vats at temperatures ranging from 26 to 28 degrees Celsius. The wine aged for some 22 months in French barriques, half of them new. Despite the warmer year, the 2015s are the freshest wines I remember from Errázuriz. They were able to harvest earlier, and all the wines feel very fresh; in the Syrah, they have low yields and stopped pushing for more ripeness and keeping the vines with enough water so they don't get stressed. This is a spicier expression with some varietal aromas, violets, raspberry leaves and sour cherries. The palate is completely dry and lively, with very fine tannins and a supple finish. This is a more complete and deeper wine than the Aconcagua Costa Syrah, but I still like the style of the Coastal better. Drink Date: 2017-2023.  Score - 93.

This intensely mineral-driven effort is most impressive but again note well that I would recommend buying this only if you have the requisite patience to cellar it accordingly as it's absolutely going to need it.

The styles are radically different. This, too, has plenty of power, but the very concentrated and very ripe mid-palate gives this a different feel - more luscious, richer and not as hard-edged. The oak gives it more cream and a more one-dimensional demeanor at first, to be sure. Still, as I played with this and let it air out, it seemed increasingly impressive. The finish became tinged with some beefy nuances and the aromatics began to show something besides wood. It seems to handle its alcohol perfectly. This has some things to prove in the cellar.

It fermented in 500-liter oak barrels with 50% of the Cabernet Franc and all of the Malbec and then matured in used oak foudres. It's very intense and powerful, but at the same time, there is a kind of lightness on the palate that makes if feel light on its feet but with great inner power. There is citrus acidity that makes it effervescent and electric. It has some 7.5 grams of acidity and a pH of 3.45, very healthy parameters. The peppery character appears after some time, giving it a Chinon-like twist, and it also reminds me of my favorite Bordeaux, Pomerol's Lafleur. This is definitely world-class and worth lying down, as it should develop further complexity in bottle. This is one of those wines where the only improvement I can think of is having magnums rather than bottles. Bravo! Some 3,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in March 2016. Drink Date: 2018-2030.

But, as it's selected from old vines in five plots in different 'parajes' - Valtomelloso, Valviejo, Las Mulgas and Corral de Serrano - it always has a small percentage of other traditional grape varieties. The vines range from 30 to 90 years old, and like the rest, they are organically farmed. The destemmed and crushed grapes fermented in oak vats with indigenous yeasts and pigéage. It underwent malolactic in barrique and then matured in larger oak casks for 18 months. Again, there is a difference in precision, brightness and depth from la Montesa to this Propiedad. This is, in Palacios's mind, an old-vine cuvée from Alfaro. The palate combines juicy fruit with earthy tones, very fine tannins and balsamic, Mediterranean herbs and a tasty, almost salty finish. Transparent, subtle and delicious, with some hints of the wines from yesteryear. For Palacios, this should be the typical wine from Alfaro - and a very good one at that! 40,000 bottles produced.

There was new ownership at Latour by this time, and a new vat room was completed just prior to the harvest this year. The 1996 Latour is medium to deep garnet in color with a profound earthy, meaty, gamey nose with hints of blueberry preserves, crème de cassis and pencil shavings. The palate is full-bodied, concentrated and packed with muscular fruit, with a firm, ripe, grainy backbone and epically long finish. Showing much more youthfully than the 2000 tasted on the same day and still possessing bags of youthful fruit in the mid-palate, this beauty is going to go on and on! Score - 99.

Château Montrose 2000,510.0,Bordeaux Red,"Tasted at the vertical in London, the question was whether the 2000 Montrose would be paradigmatic of a vintage whereby the wines have remained sullen and broody in their youth. On this occasion, to my surprise I found it more open than the 2005 (which admittedly is not saying that it's open for business!). It is a blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot picked from 22 September to 7 October. I afforded it a couple of hours in the glass and it responded with plenty of pure ripe blackberry and raspberry fruit, hints of cold slate and even charcoal emerging with time. The palate is not as complex as the aforementioned 2005, yet there is wonderful backbone and focus; towards the finish there is a sense of suppleness and refinement that might make this absolutely delicious in 5-7 years' time. Perhaps the 2000 has been usurped by subsequent releases in 2005, 2009 and 2010, but do not be surprised if it evolves into a regal Montrose. Drink Date: 2023-2060. Score - 94+.

Cardinale Red 2014,485.0,Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot,"A magnificent wine made by the brilliant winemaker Chris Carpenter, who also works for the Kendall-Jackson empire at Lakoya and a handful of other estates, this blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Merlot is sourced from multiple vineyards owned by the Jacksons, from Veeder Peak to Spring Mountain to Howell Mountain. In 2014, it reminded me of a great vintage of Pontet-Canet from Pauillac, but slightly bigger than life. The inky purple color, the stunning nose of cedar wood, unsmoked cigar tobacco, graphite, crème de cassis and subtle new oak is followed by a multi-layered, profoundly concentrated, large-scaled wine with sensational levels of blackcurrant fruit moving toward blackberries.

Pingus 2012,1220.0,Tempranillo,"... The 2012 is produced with the biodynamically grown grapes from two very old Tempranillo plots (over 80 years of age), totaling 4.5 hectares in La Horra (Burgos): Barroso is located in an old Duero terrace with a gravel and sandy soil on a chalk and clay subsoil, and San Cristobal which is a clay southwest facing slope. In this vintage, 46% of the clusters fermented with the stems in small, 2,000-liter oak foudres. Malolactic fermentation was carried out in used French oak barrels and the wine was aged for 21 months in second-use French oak barriques: no new oak was used at all. 2012 is really impressive; the word that comes to mind is precision. It's a really focused, sharp, elegant, harmonious and subtle Ribera, with a mixture of earth, fruit and spice singing in the same wave length. The palate is medium to full-bodied, with a level of precision and integration difficult to find. The tannins have an impressive silky texture, great length and persistence.

MacMurray Russian River Valley Pinot Noir 2015,27.95,Pinot Noir,"Remember the film star Fred MacMurray? Of course you don't. You're too young for that. Or maybe you aren't? He was brilliant in 1944's Double Indemnity, directed by Billy Wilder, and went on to the more memorable, bittersweet 1960 Wilder comedy The Apartment, with Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon. Playing against the type of that Apartment role, he became the warm-hearted dad in the long-running 1960s TV series My Three Sons. But I digress. MacMurray had a cattle-and-crop ranch in northern California, a gorgeous site not open to visitors. The actor, who died in 1991 before vines were planted on the estate, could not have envisioned that the area would become the wine paradise it is now.

Within the Piedra Infinita vineyard they look for the soils that have some 30 to 50 centimeters of soil before getting to the limestone, so the ripening is more harmonious and the palate gains in volume and shows some meat before getting to the chalky, limestone tannins. It really improves with time in the glass and in this vintage it seems to combine elegance with length; there is more texture and, in fact, it feels built around texture and acidity. I think this is a real triumph over the natural conditions of the year. This is what the people who ask what comes after Malbec should get: expression of a place through the grape.

Elderton Command Single Vineyard Shiraz 2014,99.95,Shiraz/Syrah,"Hewn of 1894 ancient vine oomph and tannin management of aplomb, this is power corseted by a filmy, gossamer texture and sheer, strident vinosity. Put it this way, the wine could come from nowhere else, yet the overall impression is one of Elderton's newfound restraint. Oodles of dark fruit, anise, tar, camphor and a Cadbury milk chocolate creaminess coat the palate. There is a barrel ferment smokiness, too. The extraction levels are a point; the use of French and American oak sensitive. All is in a harmony and perfectly suited to the style. Drink by 2040. Score - 97.

Ornellaia 2016,239.95,Cabernet Sauvignon Blend,"Now we're talking. Tasted from barrel, the 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia will be released in May 2019. This is a luxuriant wine with profuse abundance and beaming optimism. Both the 2015 and 2016 vintages are distinguished by the supple sweetness of the tannins, but the 2016 edition has just a hair more acidity. You don't necessarily taste that freshness, but it does contribute to the linearity and the framework of the wine. This is an iconic vintage for Bolgheri. The summer was dry and warm, and temperatures cooled down at harvest leading to optimal sugar and phenolic ripeness. The next vintage, 2017, threw many more curve balls and had vintners scrambling to achieve quality by resorting to severe fruit selection and low yields. This wine is generous and thickly layered. It delivers the most beautiful sensations of Softness, Succulence and Structure. The balance between those three S's is Sublime. Drink Date: 2020-2040. Score - 96-98.

Solaia 2015,316.95,Cabernet Sauvignon Blend,"There is a magical infinity, a continuous loop of compatibilities, between the icon wines of Tuscany and the 2015 vintage. The stunning 2015 Solaia is solid evidence of this perfect alignment. This was a warm vintage that shows less favorably in my opinion in different parts of Italy and with other grapes that render their most elegant performances in the cooler vintages. I would put pure expressions of Nebbiolo and Sangiovese in this category. However, Tuscany and many of her great blended reds (made partially or fully with international grapes) operate according to a different logic. To me, their maximum expression comes when you can taste that Tuscan sunshine beaming from within. Its rays are brilliant and warm. They shine across the senses with opulence and intensity. The very name Solaia evokes the concept of sunshine and this unique Tuscan wine archetype I am referring to. With the 2015 vintage, Solaia is liquid sunshine not just in name but also in fact. The bouquet is immediately soft and sensual with dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco. The mouthfeel shows intensity and power, but you don't get any heavy residue from the dry extract (measured at 33 grams per liter). Indeed, the wine feels glossy, tonic and fresh. It is composed of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and a tiny part Cabernet Franc. There is a bit of crunch or snap that comes thanks to the more acidity-prone Sangiovese grape (the wine measures 3.5 in pH). Finally, the tannins are beautifully sweet and ripe. This wine is meticulously executed, and the 2015 vintage lives up to an ideal of what we imagine Solaia to be. It will be released about a week after this review is published. Drink Date: 2020-2050.

It fermented in concrete vats and open-top barrels and matured in barrique, each variety separately, for some ten months, after which it was blended and bottled.

Elegant, showing fine mid-palate finesse and a tightly wound feel, this sophisticated tinto also has tons of flavor, but it still always seem serious. It's not a fruit bomb. Quite possibly the best table wine I've seen from Real Companhia Velha, this is potentially special. With its impeccable balance, fine structure and concentration, it should age well. While the tannins are not particularly hard, it really needs a few years before it is opened to allow it to become more harmonious as well as more complex. Ideally, come back around 2020-2023.
